Big-O cheatSheet

    Big Os
    O(1) - Constant -no loops
    O(n) - Linear -for loops ,while loops
    O(Log N)- Logarithmic -usually searching algorithms have log(n), Binary search
    O(n^2) - Quadratic - Nested loops
    O(2^n) - Exponential - recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size N

     Note: Iterating through half a collection is still O(n),
        Two separate collections :O(a+b),if nested O(a*b).
